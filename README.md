DESCRIPTION
==================================================
`porous-LB` is a code that performs Lattice-Boltzmann simulations for the porous material.

The code calculates material permeability (using [Darcy's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy%27s_law)) and [tortuosity](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4711147) 
using BGK or MRT relaxation models.   
The calculation can be performed with periodic and non-periodic boundary condition.   

GETTING THE CODE
==================================================
* To get the code:
```
git clone git@bitbucket.org:pawelgniewek/porous-lb.git
```

* To obtain the most recent version of the code:
```
git pull origin master
```

COMPILING AND INSTALLATION - LINUX
==================================================
* Executables
To build executables run:
```
make
```

Compilation options can be set by changing proper variables in Makefile:
* `palabosRoot` points to the directory with Palabos source code
* `compileFlags` sets the compilation flags. Uncomment `-DMRT` option for MRT model


EXTERNAL LIBRARIES
================
The code requires an external library: [Palabos](http://www.palabos.org/).

USAGE
=====
Run the code with no parameters for the options list and usage:
```
./permeability
```
